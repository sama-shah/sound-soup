# 🎹 Sound Soup

**A web-based music synthesizer for creating layered beats without music theory.**

Built for experimental musicians who play by ear and want to make music that *feels* good.

## 🎵 The Story

I've played piano my whole life — not competitively, but experimentally. I'd listen to songs I loved and recreate them by ear, building my own versions piece by piece. My taste spans pop, whimsical vibes, house/trap, and dark R&B. What I chase is that **dopamine rush** you get from a remix that plays with layers and emotions — switching between hype, mellow, jazzy, or bossa nova moods.

Despite what people might expect, I never learned much formal music theory. I built my ear through experimentation. That's exactly why I created Sound Soup: **to let anyone make beats and layer sounds that sound good without needing to know scales, intervals, or chord progressions.**

Sound Soup is inspired by the digital omnichord — that magical instrument with built-in chord buttons and a strumplate. But I wanted more: more sounds, more genres, more creative freedom. So I built this.

## ✨ What Makes Sound Soup Special

### 🎹 Built-In Chords
No need to know what notes make up a G7 or C minor. Just press a button and the chord is ready. The Chord Matrix gives you:
- **9 chord roots** (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C#, D#)
- **3 chord types** (Major, Minor, 7th)

That's 27 chords at your fingertips.

### 🎸 Strumplate
Inspired by the omnichord, the strumplate is pre-configured to perfectly layer on top of whatever chord you've selected. Just swipe across the keys and it sounds right — no wrong notes.

### 🎧 Five Sound Modes
Switch between different vibes:
- **Omnichord** – The classic warm, harp-like sound
- **Harp** – Bright and ethereal
- **House** – Punchy and electronic
- **Trap** – Dark and moody
- **Drop** – Heavy bass for those big moments

### 🥁 Built-In Effects
Add percussion and ear candy:
- **Kick, Snare, Hat, Clap** – Build your rhythm
- **Sweep, Laser, Drop** – Add transitions and hype

### 🎛️ Multi-Track Recording
Layer up to 4 tracks and loop them together. Build a beat, record a melody, add effects — then layer it all into something unique.
