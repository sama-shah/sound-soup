# welcome to sound soup :p
https://sama-shah.github.io/sound-soup/

this web app acts just like it sounds. a mixture of sounds thrown together to make you feel warm inside. each time you come across a new vegatable in your soup that tastes good is the same feeling each layer you add to your track feels as you remix your favorite songs. call me a poet or whatever.

**Sound Soup is a web-based music synthesizer to dress up a song into another genre. i use this app as a way to create tracks that layers over the song i am listening to to turn it into a whimsical/house/trap remix.**

Inspired by the way i use dj.app and onlineomnichord.com, i designed sound soup for experimental musicians who have an ear for music but dont care to pull up & relearn music theory just to execute a vision. more people need to make music that *feels* good - something between new and nostalgic.

## why did i make this?

i've played piano my whole life. not competitively, but experimentally. i'd listen to songs I loved and recreate them by ear, boften turning mellow songs upbeat or upbeat songs mellow. my taste in music spans pop, whimsical vibes, house/trap, and dark R&B. What I chase is the **dopamine rush** i get when i hear a small artist on tik tok make a remix of a song that only 60 ppl on the internet has seen yet it just changed my life. like what do you mean you just casually made a bollywood pop song sound bossa nova?? and flawlessly too.

i never learned much formal music theory. I built my ear through experimentation, and i intent for sound soup to be the gateway for people who love music to create music without the whole skill barrier of buying and using fancy equipment.

## what i love about sound soup <3

### multiple sounds
i've added sounds that i believe make it so easy to make anything have a little house, trap, or whimsicalness to it. here's the 3 main ways.

### 1. built-in chords
No need to know what notes make up a G7 or C minor. Just press a button and the chord plays for you. the strumplate is programmed to match the chord you're playing n the matrix so that it can be strummed on top of the chord, and there's no way it could sound bad. this is the omnichord fucntionality of the board, except it can be harp, house, or trap as well.

### 2. sound modes across the board
Switch between different vibes:
- **Omnichord** – The classic warm, harp-like sound
- **Harp** – Bright and ethereal
- **House** – Punchy and electronic
- **Trap** – Dark and moody
- **Drop** – Heavy bass for those big moments

### 3. piano & sound effects
access to a piano and sound effects allows another tier of freedom in case you want to add in a melody here and there. of course, you have a few sound options to choose from here. these are controlled with an on/off button so that keyboard controls are not overriden between features of the board.

### 3. record your beat/voice and layer!
layer up to 4 tracks and loop them together. build a beat with the board and voice record whatever sounds you want to add. you can record another track while the other tracks playback by clicking "play all" (like you're ed sheeran on stage looping a song together #aurapoints)

## Read the tutorial on the site! Here's a tldr:
### Getting started
1. **pick a chord** from the Chord Matrix (try C Major to start)
2. **play the strumplate** by clicking or dragging across the 12 keys indicated (number row: 1 through "=")
3. **switch sound modes** to find the vibe you want
4. **add effects** with the FX buttons (Kick, Snare, etc.)

### Creating Layers
1. hit **REC** on Track 1
2. play your chord progression on the strumplate
3. hit **STOP** when you're done
4. select Track 2 and **REC** again
5. add a melody on the piano keyboard or more strumplate
6. keep layering until you've built your sound

### General Tips 

**Pop / Whimsical**
- Use **Omnichord** or **Harp** mode
- Stick to Major chords (C, D, E, F, G)
- Keep it bright and melodic

**House / Trap**
- Switch to **House** or **Trap** mode
- Use Minor and 7th chords for mood
- Layer in **Kick** and **Hat** for rhythm
- Add **Sweep** for build-ups

**Dark R&B**
- Use **Trap** mode
- Focus on Minor chords and 7th chords
- Slower BPM (70-90)
- Add **Snare** and subtle **Laser** effects

**Experimental**
- Mix modes between tracks
- Try unexpected chord progressions
- Use the **Drop** effect for transitions
- Adjust BPM mid-song with the metronome
